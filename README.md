# Neutralinojs React Tailwind Template
```sh
git clone git@github.com:maael/neutralinojs-react-tailwind-template.git
cd neutralinojs-react-tailwind-template
npm i
neu update
npm run dev
```

# Features

- Neutralino.js
- React
- Tailwind

All with hot reload, as parallel processes. Build will also purge the unused Tailwind, to keep sizes minimal.

Probably the best way to add different screens is something like `react-router`.
